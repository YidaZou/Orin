I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 15, in script call
    call chapter1
  File "game/chapter1.rpy", line 82, in script
    p worried "We can’t have corruption running into your world now can we?"
Exception: Say has image attributes (u'worried',), but there's no image tag associated with the speaking character.
